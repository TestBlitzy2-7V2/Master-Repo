/**
 * HTTP request handler function for the backpropagation testing server foundation.
 * Currently serves a basic "Hello, World!" response while the system awaits implementation
 * of core backpropagation testing capabilities. This handler will be extended to support
 * planned API endpoints for test orchestration, algorithm validation, and results reporting.
 * 
 * @description Handles all incoming HTTP requests and returns a plain text response.
 *              Forms the base communication layer for the future backpropagation integration
 *              testing framework, enabling automated test execution and result reporting.
 * @param {http.IncomingMessage} req - The HTTP request object containing client request data,
 *                                     headers, URL, and method information from external systems
 *                                     such as developer tools, CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring services
 * @param {http.ServerResponse} res - The HTTP response object used to send data back to the client,
 *                                    providing methods to set status codes, headers, and response body
 * @returns {void} This function does not return a value but sends an HTTP response through the res object
 * @example
 * // Example HTTP request to the server:
 * // GET / HTTP/1.1
 * // Host: 127.0.0.1:3000
 * //
 * // Expected response:
 * // HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 * // Content-Type: text/plain
 * // Hello, World!
 * 
 * @example
 * // Server response flow for any HTTP request:
 * // 1. Request received by handler function
 * // 2. Status code set to 200 (OK)
 * // 3. Content-Type header set to 'text/plain'
 * // 4. Response body sent as 'Hello, World!\n'
 * // 5. Connection closed after response completion
 */

/**
 * Server startup callback function executed when the HTTP server successfully begins listening.
 * Provides confirmation that the backpropagation testing server foundation is operational
 * and ready to accept incoming connections. This callback is crucial for deployment validation
 * and monitoring system integration, as it indicates successful server initialization.
 * 
 * @description Logs a confirmation message to the console indicating the server is running
 *              and accessible at the specified hostname and port. This output is used by
 *              deployment scripts, monitoring systems, and developers to verify successful
 *              server startup and network availability.
 * @returns {void} This function does not return a value but outputs a status message to console
 * @example
 * // Console output when server starts successfully:
 * // Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
 * //
 * // This message indicates:
 * // 1. HTTP server is bound to localhost (127.0.0.1)
 * // 2. Server is listening on port 3000
 * // 3. Service is ready to accept HTTP requests
 * // 4. Base URL for accessing the server is provided
 * 
 * @example
 * // Usage in deployment scripts:
 * // 1. Start the server process
 * // 2. Monitor console output for this message
 * // 3. Proceed with integration tests once message appears
 * // 4. Use the displayed URL for health checks and monitoring
